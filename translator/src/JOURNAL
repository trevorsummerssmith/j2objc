* Finished adding 'true'.

* Left off at printMethodInvocationNameAndArgs
  - we are replacing the ArrayCreation node with a method invocation.
  - Array.make 3; prints correctly!
  - DONE correctly generate type for foo (now is 'Array *')

The codebase appears to mutate the java ast via the Translate phase not into
an objc ast, nor a java ast, but something halfway in between. The generate
phase takes that modified ast and generates the objc. At my first read it seems
like a lot of the logic is tightly coupled between the translate and generation
phases. Will proceed by implementing a few unit tests until I have a better
understanding of the approach.
