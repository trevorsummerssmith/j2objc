* Will continue now with the most simple language primitives.

* Finished adding 'true' for array.

* Left off at printMethodInvocationNameAndArgs
  - we are replacing the ArrayCreation node with a method invocation.
  - Array.make 3; prints correctly!
  - DONE correctly generate type for foo (now is 'Array *')

The codebase appears to mutate the java ast via the Translate phase not into
an objc ast, nor a java ast, but something halfway in between. The generate
phase takes that modified ast and generates the objc. At my first read it seems
like a lot of the logic is tightly coupled between the translate and generation
phases. Will proceed by implementing a few unit tests until I have a better
understanding of the approach.

Primitive type mappings:
       java     bits      ocaml
 *   - byte    8bits    char
 *   - short  16bits    int   TODO Numbers.Int16
 *   - int    32bits    int   TODO Int32
 *   - long   64bits    int   TODO Int64
 *   - float  32bits    float TODO
 *   - double 32bits    float TODO
 *   - char             Uchar.t
 *   - String           string
 *   - boolean          bool

- arrays - for now just used the above primitive with array type
  - Maybe should use BigArray?

- Will use FIXTEST to note unit tests I want to come back to

TODO/Questions:
* add `type t` to modules
* figure out 'ref' for everything
* recursively defined types?
* Concurrency and jvm runtime properties, how do these translate?
* How to represent the fact that all variables are mutable?
  - (option 1) make everything mutable. variables with 'final' keyword can be immutable.
  - is there some way to make multiple interfaces? a mutable one (so that all of the library code will compile as-is) and an immutable one?
* Should we translate all types to bit specific eg Int32?
  - perhaps in later versions this is an option?
* final variables - could expose these as readonly. the downside here is that
  if the code removes the final, the types will all break, but that's probably ok.
* Class arrays with no initializer eg Integer[] foo = new Integer[3];
  from ArrayCreationTest. Need to figure out what to do, as OCaml
  arrays require a value for initialization. I am thinking we can
  recursively traverse the constructor and insert primitive values into
  everything until we bottom out. This has the drawback that we'll need
  signatures for all transitive deps... but i think thats pretty standard
  anyhow with java projects.
 * Unicode -- see UnicodeUtils.format -- what does ocaml src accept these days?
